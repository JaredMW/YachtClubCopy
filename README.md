# YachtClubCopy
For my Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving II class project, me and four other people made a game over the course of the semester. This is not the original version of the project, however - the original can be found at https://github.com/PKBanta/GDAPS-Yacht-Club . The reason why I have re-uploaded it here is that I committed to the project through SourceTree, and thus my contributions to the project do not show up on my account on Github, but rather as a person named "Jared White (RIT Student Account)", which is not a Git account. This is a copy of the full version of the project, with a couple changes, simply to showcase it on my profile. To see the original project and any contributions made by me or anyone else, please feel free to view the original link referenced prior.
